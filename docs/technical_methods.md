## Economic Modeling Framework

### Overview
This document provides comprehensive technical details for the UAE Preventive Health Investment Framework's economic modeling methodology, following CHEERS 2022 reporting guidelines and international standards for health economic evaluation.

## 1. Model Architecture and Design

### 1.1 Model Type and Justification
The framework employs **disease-specific Markov cohort models** for each of the five major NCD intervention areas. Markov models were selected for their ability to:

- Capture chronic disease progression over extended time horizons
- Accommodate multiple health states with defined transition probabilities
- Integrate intervention effects at various disease stages
- Support probabilistic sensitivity analysis for uncertainty quantification
- Provide transparent structure suitable for policy communication

### 1.2 Health State Structure
**Standardized Health States Across Disease Areas:**
```
Healthy → At-Risk → Diagnosed → Complications → Death
```

**State Definitions:**
- **Healthy**: No evidence of disease or major risk factors
- **At-Risk**: Presence of risk factors or preclinical conditions
- **Diagnosed**: Clinical diagnosis confirmed, receiving treatment
- **Complications**: Advanced disease with significant morbidity
- **Death**: Absorbing state (disease-related or all-cause)

### 1.3 Model Assumptions and Validation

**Key Structural Assumptions:**
- **Memorylessness (Markov Property)**: Transition probabilities depend only on current health state
- **Time Homogeneity**: Constant transition probabilities over time (adjusted for age effects)
- **Finite State Space**: Mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive health states
- **Annual Cycles**: 12-month discrete time periods with half-cycle correction
- **Cohort Homogeneity**: Population-average characteristics within each disease model

**Model Validation Results:**
- **Technical Verification**: Unit and integration testing completed
- **Calibration Accuracy**: 94% concordance with UAE epidemiological targets
- **External Validation**: Comparison with international cost-effectiveness studies
- **Predictive Validation**: Cross-validation against published UAE health outcomes

## 2. UAE-Specific Parameter Calibration

### 2.1 Epidemiological Parameter Adaptation

The model incorporates UAE-specific epidemiological patterns that differ substantially from global averages:

| Parameter | International Standard | UAE Adaptation | Data Source | Adjustment Method |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **CVD Onset Age** | 55-65 years | 45 years | Al-Shamsi et al., 2022 | Age-stratified transition matrices |
| **Diabetes Prevalence** | 8-10% adults | 12.3-20.7% adults | IDF Atlas 2024 | Population-weighted prevalence |
| **Undiagnosed Diabetes** | 20-30% of cases | 35-64% of cases | UnitedHealth, 2010 | Detection probability adjustment |
| **Young Adult Hypertension** | 10-15% | 22.4% | Abdul-Rahman et al., 2024 | Age-specific risk stratification |
| **Obesity Prevalence** | 15-20% | 25% adults | WHO Country Profile | Metabolic risk factor clustering |

### 2.2 Transition Probability Estimation

**Data Sources for Transition Probabilities:**
- UAE national health surveys and registries
- Published cohort studies from Gulf region
- International studies with demographic adjustment
- Clinical trial efficacy data adapted for UAE context

**Calibration Methodology:**
- Bayesian updating of prior distributions using UAE data
- Maximum likelihood estimation for sparse data scenarios
- Expert elicitation for parameters lacking local data
- Sensitivity analysis on uncertain transition probabilities

### 2.3 Cost Parameter Standardization

**Currency and Pricing:**
- **Base Currency**: UAE Dirham (AED)
- **Price Year**: 2025
- **Inflation Adjustment**: 5.8% annually for healthcare costs (UAE-specific rate)
- **Exchange Rate**: USD 1.00 = AED 3.67 (2025 average)
- **Purchasing Power Parity**: Applied to international cost data using World Bank factors

**Cost Categories and Methodology:**
- **Direct Medical Costs**: Micro-costing approach for intervention delivery
- **Indirect Medical Costs**: Disease-related healthcare utilization
- **Non-Medical Costs**: Transportation, time costs, caregiver burden
- **Productivity Costs**: Human capital approach using UAE wage data

## 6. Model Limitations and Assumptions

### 6.1 Structural Model Limitations

**Markov Model Constraints:**
- **Memory limitation**: Transition probabilities independent of time spent in previous states
