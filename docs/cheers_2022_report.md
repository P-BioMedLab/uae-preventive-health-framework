# Economic Evaluation of Preventive Health Interventions in the United Arab Emirates: A Comprehensive Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

## Abstract

**Background:** The United Arab Emirates faces a significant burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with cardiovascular disease onset occurring 10-20 years earlier than global averages. Current healthcare spending allocates only 1% to prevention versus 57% to curative care.

**Objective:** To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and return on investment of a comprehensive preventive health portfolio targeting five major NCD areas in the UAE.

**Methods:** We conducted a societal perspective economic evaluation using disease-specific Markov cohort models with a 10-year time horizon. The analysis included five interventions: cardiovascular disease prevention (500,000 adults), diabetes prevention (750,000 adults), cancer screening programs (1,126,000 adults), osteoporosis prevention (234,000 adults), and Alzheimer's disease prevention (30,000 adults). Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. Uncertainty was characterized through 10,000-iteration probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

**Results:** The prevention portfolio requires AED 20.4 billion investment over 10 years, generating AED 52.4 billion in benefits (157% ROI). The intervention prevents 158,080 disease events and averts 16,325 premature deaths, gaining 326,280 QALYs at AED 62,600 per QALY. All interventions demonstrated cost-effectiveness below the UAE threshold of AED 150,000 per QALY, with 98.7% probability of cost-effectiveness.

**Conclusions:** Preventive health interventions represent exceptional value for money in the UAE context, with early break-even at 4.2 years and substantial population health benefits. Implementation should be prioritized for health system transformation.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Rationale

The United Arab Emirates confronts an escalating non-communicable disease (NCD) epidemic, with NCDs accounting for 68% of all deaths and cardiovascular disease onset occurring at age 45 versus the global average of 55-65 years. Despite this burden, current healthcare resource allocation dedicates only 1% of expenditure to preventive care compared to 57% for curative services.

The UAE's "We the UAE 2031" vision emphasizes prevention-focused healthcare transformation, yet evidence-based economic frameworks for prevention investment decisions remain limited. International evidence demonstrates prevention's cost-effectiveness, but UAE-specific analysis incorporating local epidemiological patterns, healthcare costs, and population characteristics is essential for policy decision-making.

### 1.2 Objectives

Primary objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and return on investment of a comprehensive preventive health intervention portfolio in the UAE.

Secondary objectives:
- Quantify health outcomes including disease events prevented and deaths averted
- Assess economic impact including healthcare savings and productivity gains  
- Characterize uncertainty through probabilistic sensitivity analysis
- Provide evidence-based recommendations for prevention investment priorities

---

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 Target Population and Subgroups

The analysis targets UAE adult population (7.5 million) across five intervention-specific subgroups:

- **Cardiovascular Disease Prevention:** 500,000 high-risk adults (7% of adult population with elevated CVD risk factors)
- **Diabetes Prevention:** 750,000 pre-diabetic adults (10% of adult population with impaired glucose tolerance)
- **Cancer Screening:** 1,126,000 screening-eligible adults (456,000 women aged 40-70 for mammography; 670,000 adults aged 50-75 for colorectal screening)
- **Osteoporosis Prevention:** 234,000 at-risk adults aged 50+ (primarily post-menopausal women and high-risk men)
- **Alzheimer's Prevention:** 30,000 high-risk elderly aged 65+ (those with multiple risk factors or mild cognitive impairment)

Population estimates derive from UAE Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre data, adjusted for 2025 demographics.

### 2.2 Setting and Location

United Arab Emirates healthcare system, including:
- **Public sector:** Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP), Dubai Health Authority (DHA), Department of Health - Abu Dhabi (DoH)
- **Private sector:** Private hospitals, clinics, and employer-sponsored health programs
- **Geographic scope:** All seven emirates with population-weighted analysis

### 2.3 Study Perspective

Societal perspective including:
- Direct medical costs (intervention delivery, healthcare utilization, treatment costs)
- Indirect costs (productivity losses, caregiver burden)
- Patient out-of-pocket expenses
- Administrative and infrastructure costs

### 2.4 Comparators

**Intervention scenario:** Implementation of evidence-based prevention programs
**Comparator scenario:** Current standard of care (status quo) with existing prevention activities

Interventions include:
- CVD: Comprehensive risk factor management (statins, hypertension control, lifestyle modification)
- Diabetes: Intensive lifestyle intervention programs based on Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)
- Cancer: Enhanced breast and colorectal screening with FIT-first strategy
- Osteoporosis: DEXA screening with targeted treatment for high-risk individuals
- Alzheimer's: Multidomain intervention including MIND diet, cognitive training, risk factor optimization

### 2.5 Time Horizon

Primary analysis: 10 years (2025-2034)
Sensitivity analysis: 5 and 20 years

Ten-year horizon captures intervention implementation, early health benefits, and cost recovery while minimizing long-term projection uncertainty.

### 2.6 Discount Rate

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Study Findings

This comprehensive economic evaluation demonstrates exceptional value for preventive health investments in the UAE, with 157% ROI and cost-effectiveness well below accepted thresholds. The prevention portfolio addresses the UAE's unique epidemiological profile where NCDs manifest 10-20 years earlier than global averages, creating substantial opportunities for intervention.

Key findings include:
- **Strong economic case:** Every AED invested returns AED 2.57 over 10 years
- **Rapid payback:** Break-even achieved in 4.2 years, earlier than most infrastructure investments
- **Population health impact:** 158,080 disease events prevented, exceeding 1% of total adult population
- **Healthcare system relief:** 35% reduction in targeted condition healthcare utilization

The analysis reveals intervention heterogeneity with CVD prevention offering highest ROI (180%) due to early disease onset and high event costs, while diabetes prevention provides greatest absolute impact due to large target population. All interventions demonstrate cost-effectiveness, supporting comprehensive portfolio implementation rather than selective intervention deployment.

### 4.2 Limitations

**Model limitations:**
- Markov cohort approach assumes population homogeneity; individual-level microsimulation could capture greater heterogeneity
- Annual cycle length may not capture short-term clinical events optimally
- Static population model doesn't account for demographic transitions or migration patterns
- Intervention interactions not explicitly modeled (potential for synergistic effects)

**Data limitations:**
- Limited UAE-specific cost data necessitated international cost adaptation using purchasing power parity
- Long-term intervention effectiveness projections based on clinical trial data may not reflect real-world persistence
- Quality-of-life valuations based on recently developed UAE EQ-5D-5L value set requiring longer-term validation
- Private sector utilization patterns estimated due to limited data availability

**Methodological limitations:**
- 10-year time horizon may not capture full lifetime benefits of prevention
- Productivity cost estimation using human capital approach may over- or underestimate economic impact
- Discount rate sensitivity not fully explored (3% used throughout)
- Healthcare system capacity constraints not explicitly modeled

### 4.3 Generalizability

Results are specifically calibrated for UAE context but methodology applicable to other Gulf Cooperation Council countries with similar:
- High NCD burden with early onset patterns
- Resource-rich healthcare systems
- Expatriate-majority populations
- Mandatory employer health insurance systems

International generalizability limited by:
- Unique UAE epidemiological patterns (early CVD onset, high diabetes prevalence)
- Healthcare cost structures and financing mechanisms
- Population demographics and cultural factors affecting intervention uptake
- Healthcare infrastructure and capacity differences

### 4.4 Current Knowledge Context

This analysis represents the first comprehensive economic evaluation of preventive health interventions in the UAE, addressing a critical evidence gap for regional health policy. Findings align with international prevention cost-effectiveness literature while highlighting UAE-specific opportunities and challenges.

The 157% ROI exceeds most published prevention studies (typically 50-150% ROI) due to:
- Earlier disease onset creating larger prevention windows
- High healthcare costs making prevention relatively more valuable
- Young population demographics extending life-year gains
- Comprehensive portfolio approach capturing synergies

Results support WHO recommendations for prevention investment but provide UAE-specific evidence for policy implementation. The economic case strengthens arguments for healthcare financing reform prioritizing prevention over curative care.
